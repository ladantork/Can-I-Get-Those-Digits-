# Can-I-Get-Those-Digits?

Instructions
The extractNumbers function takes a string as an argument. This string will contain consecutive digits among other characters that should be extracted. The function should return these digits as a number.

Although there are multiple ways of achieving this, make sure to use a regular expression.

Example
extractNumbers('a123b') // returns 123
extractNumbers('jajd86430jksjdk') // returns 86430
